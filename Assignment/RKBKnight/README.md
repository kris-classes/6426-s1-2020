This pyxel application shows a random or sorted list heapified.
The main.py is the main file and the heap_priority_queue.py is the skeleton of this project
as this is were all the processing happens. 



ISSUES
One of the main issues while doing the project was getting the positions of the when the
mouse was clicked. Another issue this project had was with copying a queue to another queue for 
which needed to take the value one by one from the main queue and then append it to the new queue
and then return the new queue. 


Strengths of Priority Queue
One of the main strengths of a heap priority queue is that you can add new values
to it efficiently after initially constructing it as it uses a binary heap.
Another strength of priority queues is that it is easy to implement. When using 
this data structure for scheduling, the priority of the processes can be achieved
easily with a priority queue.

Disadvantages of priority queue
One of the may be slower than optimal and may use lots of space to store all records.


REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

Can be used in operating system for load balancing and interrupt handling

ASYMPTOMATIC ISSUES

Space Complexity Worst = O(log N) means that the algorithm's maximum running time 
is proportional to the logarithm of the input size.

Time Complexity Average = Î˜(N log N)
