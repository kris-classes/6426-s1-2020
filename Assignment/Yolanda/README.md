## 1.A paragraph documenting issues you encountered in the design or implementation of your chosen data structure/algorithm. 
```bash
My problem focused on the initial design stage. 
The data structure I chose is the stack, but at the beginning I did not think about what kind of visualization mode to use to display my stack.
Spend a lot of time on the wrong visual model (main). 
Another problem is that I am not proficient in the use of Pyxel, and I did not find the tutorial I wanted on the Internet. 
Although this is an open assignment, I can learn through other people`s assignment, but towards the end of the semester, most of the students are busy with the exam and have not completed their assignments.
These are my main problems with two aspects.
```
## 2.Briefly explain the strengths and weaknesses of your data structure or algorithm with respect to resource consumption. Under what conditions does it perform the best or worst? 
```bash
The stack is a simple data structure used to store data. 
In the stack, the order in which data arrives is important. 
The stack is ideal for executing sequential access rules (ie LIFO). 
In the stack, we can dynamically allocate memory. 
Due to dynamic memory allocation, if we do not use all memory space, it will waste memory space. We can easily add or remove elements from the stack. 
The stack is also used to reverse things.
```
## 3.List a real-world application of your chosen data structure or algorithm. 
```bash
Examples of stacks in "real life":
    The stack of trays in a cafeteria;
    A stack of plates in a cupboard;
    A driveway that is only one car wide.
Examples of stacks in computing:
    Back/Forward stacks on browsers;
    Undo/Redo stacks in Excel or Word;
    Activation records of method calls;
```
## 4.A sentence or two on the asymptotic worst-case time and space complexity of your chosen data structure/algorithm.
```bash
For all the standard stack operations (push, pop, isEmpty, size), the worst-case run-time complexity can be O(1).Â 
Time complexity depends on the number of elements in the stack.
```
