      For creating the data structure I feel like it was not that difficult only to create the random sets but what I found difficult was the designing part 
where I have to select the color for the text and aligning the rectangles as well as adjusting the size of the text and the rectanglesthis was the difficulty I feel like I 
encountered more during the assignment.

The stength of my data structure is that it explains some basic set operations in a colorful way and I think it is quite interesting the weekness is that it only creates a limited
length(elements in the set) of 2 set and operates in those 2 sets and cannot increase the length of the set the window size I selected was not sufficient i feel.

The real world application would be if there were students who needed to see what are set and see some of the basic operations performed in the set and visualize it the 
data stucture can be used for such visualization.
