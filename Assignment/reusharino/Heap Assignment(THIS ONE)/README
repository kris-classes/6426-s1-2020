ISSUES

The primary issues encountered in this project have been comprehension of
the pyxel module, the implementation of heaps has not been a major issue as illustrated
by the minHeap.py and maxHeap.py files. The primary issue has been the actual animation
of the processes performed by the files previously mentioned. This may just be a human
error issue.


PERKS OF HEAPS
Heaps being complete binary trees have the benefit of being fast where depth
first searches are concerned as well as being useful for removing the smallest
or largest items from a list.
Being that heaps can be used for process scheduling it can be assumed that they
are not hugely resource intensive.
Smaller input sizes for heaps will work faster to a certain point however worst
case being being a constant number heaps in a sense dont really have preferable
conditions compared to any given structure where worst case time complexity is
something like O(n^2)


REAL-WORLD APPLICATION
Process scheduling at kernel level


ASYMPTOMATIC ISSUES
Space Complexity Worst = O(n)
means an algorithm will only check a structure a constant number of times

Time Complexity Average = O(log(n))
means an algorithm will the running time will grow in proportion to the input
size of a given input

Time Complexity Worst = O(n)
means an algorithm will only check a structure a constant number of times
