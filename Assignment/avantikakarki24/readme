### 1.A paragraph documenting issues you encountered in the design or implementation of your chosen data structure/algorithm. 

I faced a couple of issues while implementing my chosen data structure which was Queue.
In the beginning i was not sure how to start the project , i tried looking for some online 
learning material but there was nothiing online so then i looked at some stuff which our lecturer
gave us and tried to understand how pyxel works and what are the stuffs that we can do with it.

### Briefly explain the strengths and weaknesses of your data structure or algorithm
with respect to resource consumption. Under what conditions does it perform
the best or worst?

A queue is a linear datastructure which works on the priniple of FIFO(First in First Out).
The best example of a queue data structure is queue of customers , the customer who comes first is served first.
A queue is open on both the ends.
Once a new element is inserted into the Queue, all the elements inserted before 
the new element in the queue must be removed, to remove the new element.
The main limitation of queues in a data structure is one of the basic operations of deleting an element from it is cumbersome.


### List a real-world application of your chosen data structure or algorithm.

1. Call center phone system uses queue data structure to serve the customers calls
2. serving requests on  single shared resource like printer, CPU task scheduling.
3. ATM booth line
4.Determining number of cashiers to have at a supermarket.

### A sentence or two on the asymptotic worst-case time and space complexity of
your chosen data structure/algorithm.

Queues offer random access to their contents by shifting the first element off the front of the queue. 
 Therefore the time complexity for accessing the item in the queue is O(n).

Searching for a given value in the queue requires iterating until you find it.Time complexity for serching an item is O(n).
Inserting into a queue can only happen at the back of the queue. Time complexity for inserting the item in the queue is O(1).
Deleting from a queue happens at the front of the queue. Time complexity for, queue deletion is O(1).

the avaerage time complexity of queue is Î˜(n).
The worst isO(n). But it always depends upon the number of items in the queue.
