# Task 3 Analysis and Commentary

### Q1) A paragraph documenting issues you encountered in the design or implementation of your chosen data structure/algorithm.
#### There are many issues that I encountered while designing and implementing my chosen algorithm. One of The biggest issue that I encountered was to dynamically space all the nodes so that they do not overlap each other and have equal spacings if more nodes were to be added. Another issue was whilst implementing the Breadth First Search in a way such that nodes can produced randomly and assigned to the class and then to draw using all nodes into a Pyxel application. 
***
### Q2) Briefly explain the strengths and weaknesses of your data structure or algorithm with respect to resource consumption. Under what conditions does it perform the best or worst?
#### The strengths of the Breadth First Search is that, if there is a solution the algorithm will definitely find it as it stores the nodes that it has covered allowing the search to cover all nodes in a systematic way. The weakness of the data structure is that is it has to store all of the nodes that are covered in memory and this data structure may not be a good option if there are many nodes as the system would have to store each visited node in memory.
***
### Q3) List a real-world application of your chosen data structure or algorithm.
#### A real world application of Breadth First Search is that it can be used to finding the shortest path. An example of this is the GPS Navigation System/Maps. 
***
### Q4) A sentence or two on the asymptotic worst-case time and space complexity of your chosen data structure/algorithm.
#### The worst case time complexity for Breadth First Search is O(n^2)	and the space complexity is O(2^n).
