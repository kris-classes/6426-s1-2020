**Issue encountered in implementation**
The Program is based on heap sorting, in which a random array is taken and sorted and displayed in a tree format. The difficult part is that, when making the tree, every circle has to be specified with the right sorted nuumber in it, which makes a long process and also a little complicated as we have to mention its position through x and y co-ordinates.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**
Heap sort is best when it relates to a small data set as it does not require any external memory, but at the same time could take a lot of time when used for large data-sets.


**Real World Application of Heap Sort**
Priority queues are implemented using heap sort. A real life example to this would be in a licensing company, if it has customers waiting some to renew their license, some to apply for a new one and some just to pay the bill, the ones wanting to pay the bill will be taken first as that would be quick and it would reduce the waiting time.

**Worst-case time and space complexity of Heap-Sort**
The time complexity in any case for heap sort remains the same wich is O(nlog(n)). That of space complexity is O(1).
