# Lab 3 - Implement a binary max-heap data structure.

## Task 1 - Implement a priority queue using the heapq module

Make all the tests pass and fix your code until pylint gives a 10.00/10 rating.

```shell
pytest -xv heap_priority_queue_tests.py
pylint heap_priority_queue.py
```

## Task 2 - Questions - Answer these here.


Q: What is the worst-case time complexity for push() in a naïve priority queue?
A: ?

Q: What is the worst-case time complexity for peek() in a naïve priority queue?
A: ?

Q: What is the worst-case time complexity for pop() in a naïve priority queue?
A: ?

A PriorityQueue can also be implemented using a Heap data structure (you are not required to implement this in this lab).
